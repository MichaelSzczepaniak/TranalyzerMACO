<h3>What does MACO stand for and what does the MACO Analyzer do?</h3>
<p>MACO stand for Moving Average Cross-Over (MACO) and is a trading strategy which according to Alexander Elder <a href=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118443926.html>[1]</a>, dates back to shortly after WWII and credits Richard Donchian and J.M. Hurst as pioneers in it's use.  The MACO Analyzer allows a user to play with how the strategy works through simulation on historical data.  The MACO is a simple strategy with an elegant intuition making it easy to understand and a good canditate for an initial exploration into quantitative trading (QT).</p>

<p>This signal requires specifying two parameters: a slow and a fast moving average number of days.  If you are unfamiliar with moving averages, the link below describes it in detail:</p><p><a href=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp>http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp</a></p>

<p>This demo implements two kinds of moving averages: Simple and Exponentional.  A simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average price over n days and this average rolls forward looking back n days when calculating new values.  For example, if we wanted to calculate a 3 day SMA (aka SMA 3), it would look like this:</p>
<pre>
Price  SMA 3
-----  -----
42.58  no value
42.50  no value
41.82  42.30 = (42.58 + 42.50 + 41.82) / 3
41.45  41.92 = (42.50 + 41.82 + 41.45) / 3
41.55  41.61 = (41.82 + 41.45 + 42.55) / 3
41.43  41.48 = ...
</pre>

<p>The exponential moving average (EMA) is a little more complicated to compute, but has a simple interpretation. While the SMA equally weights all the prices in its calculation, the EMA puts more weight on the more recent prices making it more responsive to changes.  Details on how to do this calculation can be found here <a href=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118443926.html>[1]</a> or here <a href=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-calculate-exponential-moving-average-in-tra.html>[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The larger the number of days n used to calculate a moving an MA (SMA or EMA), the slower it reacts to changes in price because more history is factored into the calculation.  Similarly, a fast MA factors in less days in its calculation and changes more quickly because recent prices drive the calculation.</p>

<h3>How are buy and sell signals generated?</h3>
<p>A buy signal occurs when a fast MA (SMA or EMA) moves above a slow MA.  A sell signal occurs under this strategy when the fast MA drops below the slow MA.  The user selects a fast n period and a slow n period (slow n > fast n) and uses the signals generated from that choice.  A more sophisticated user might run a number of simulations and select fast and slow n values based on cross-validation of a substantial historical data set.</p>

<h3>User Selected Parameters</h3>
<h4>Quick Start</h4>
<p>The left pane of the app is where you chose the settings for the simulation.  All settings except <b>Company</b> have default settings.  To run a simulation, simply chose your desired settings and click the <b>Run Simulation</b> button.  The results from of the simulation should be displayed in the bottom two fields of the <b>Analyze</b> tab.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h4>Company</h4>
<p>The demo version of the app uses a select list populated with 10 companies: AAPL DIS, GE, JNJ, JPM, MRK, MSFT, NFLX, UNH and WMT.  For each ticker, data for the High, Low, Open, Close and Adjusted Close prices along with daily trading volume for each of these tickers from 2005-01-03 to 2016-05-24 are available for use by the simulator.</p>

<h4>Quote Date Range</h4>
<p>This section determines the starting and ending dates of the simulation.  In the demo version, the earliest starting date is January 3, 2005 and the latest ending date is May 24, 2016.</p>

<h4>Moving Average (MA)</h4>
<p>This section determines which type of moving average the simulator should use to calculate its signals.  The EMA is more responsive to recent price changes, but with that responsiveness typically comes more frequent false signals <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiE1VgWdcQM>aka 'whipsaws'</a>.</p>

<h4>Fast & Slow MA Days</h4>
<p>These are the fast n and slow n days respectively as discussed above.  The left handle on the range widget sets the fast n days (which are always lower than the slow n days).  The smaller the value for fast n days, the more responsive the fast MA resulting in more cross-over signals the strategy will generate.</p>

<h4>Starting Account Balance</h4>
<p>This is the amount of starting capital the simulator uses.  The amount of each purchase or sale of shares is deducted or added to this balance respectively.  The number of shares bought or sold is determined by the <b>Position Managerment</b> setting described in the next section.</p>

<h4>Position Management</h4>
<p>This setting determines how many shares are purchased when a buy signal is given or how many shares are sold when a sell signal is given.  The demo has only one setting: AIAO-OPAAT-OL which stand for <i>"All in, all out, one position at a time, only long positions allowed"</i>.  This is the simpliest strategy where the maximum number of shares the current account balance can afford are purchased when a buy signal is given and all the currently held share are sold when a sell signal is given.</p>
<p>Additional PM strategies are planned for the non-demo version of this app such as: absolute trailing stops, percent trailing stops, absolute loss, percent loss, and a variety of technical stops.</p>

<h4>Run Simulation</h4>
<p>Clicking this button will run a simulation based on the current settings.  You'll see an error in the last two fields of the Analyze tab if the Company is not set.</p>

<h3>Analyze Tab</h3>
This the default tab that is opened when the app is initially launched.  The first two fields report the setting to be used for the simulation.  The bottom two fields report the results of the simulation.
<h4>Quote Data Status</h4>
<p>Before a company in selected, this field will report <i>Select Company ticker to acquire quote data.</i>.  This message changes to report the company ticker and the date range once these fields are set.  A company must be selected before a simulation is run.  You'll see an error the bottom two fields if try to run a simulation without at least selecting the company ticker.</p>
<h4>Simulation Parameters</h4>
<p>This section reports the type of moving average, fast n and slow n days to be used in the simulation in a compact form: SMA for the simple moving average, EMA for exponential moving average followed by the fast and slow n in parenthesis. The next columns shows the starting account balance which is followed by the position management strategy.</p>
<h4>Trades using MA...</h4>
<p>This table shows the results of the simulation. Each row describes a completed transaction with the buy and sell dates, the buy and sell prices, and the net profit or loss from the roundtrip transaction.</p>
<h4>Net Trading Profit/Loss</h4>
<p>This field shows the sum of the <b>ProfitLoss</b> column in the table above.  A positive number indicates the amount of profit generated over the period specified in the <b>Quote Date Range</b> section.  A negative number indicates a loss over that same period.</p>
<h3>Visualize Tab</h3>
<p>This page shows two charts.  The top chart shows where the buy and sell signals where generated for the strategy.  The bottom shows a breakdown of all the trades in various profit/loss ranges.</p>

<h4>Trades Identified Using This Signal</h4>
<p>Buy signals were generated above the green triangles and the sell signals generated below the red triangles.</p>
<h4>Breakdown of Simulated Trade Results</h4>
<p>The bottom chart shows a historgram summarizing each of the round-trip trades.</p>
