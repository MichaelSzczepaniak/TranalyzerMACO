<h3>Branch Descriptions</h3>
<p>There are two branches on this project.  The <b>master</b> is at <a href=https://github.com/MichaelSzczepaniak/TranalyzerMACO/tree/master>https://github.com/MichaelSzczepaniak/TranalyzerMACO/tree/master</a> and the <b>demo</b> is at <a href=https://github.com/MichaelSzczepaniak/TranalyzerMACO/tree/shinydemo>https://github.com/MichaelSzczepaniak/TranalyzerMACO/tree/shinydemo</a>.  These branches are described below.</p>

<h4>The demo Branch</h4>
<p>This version of the app is running at: <a href=https://michael-szczepaniak.shinyapps.io/tranmaco/> https://michael-szczepaniak.shinyapps.io/tranmaco/</a></p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of the demo version is the select list in the <b>Company</b> field.  Data for 10 stocks over a 10 year period were loaded with the application files.  This was done to improve user experience by lowering the risk of a user having trouble obtaining data from a live/real-time quote query.</p>

<h4>The master Branch</h4>
<p>This verion of the app allows the user to query end-of-day quote data from Yahoo.  This will eventually be the only difference between master and demo branches once changes from demo have been merged back into master.</p>

<p>This app was developed as a protype to see how some simple ideas might be implemented.  A more feature-rich version capable of more advanced simulations is planned to be done in Python.</p>

<h4>Bugs</h4>
<p>I welcome feedback on the app.  If you see an issue, kindly submit an issue from the <b>Issues</b> tab of the github repo.  Thanks!</p>
