<h3>Branch Descriptions</h3>
<p>The <b>master</b> living at <a href=https://github.com/MichaelSzczepaniak/TranalyzerMACO>https://github.com/MichaelSzczepaniak/TranalyzerMACO</a> is the version that is deployed and running at: <a href=https://michael-szczepaniak.shinyapps.io/tranmaco/> https://michael-szczepaniak.shinyapps.io/tranmaco/</a></p>

<p>Other branches typically start with the prefix <b>dev_</b> for <b>development</b> followed by a descriptor such as <b>cv</b> for <b>cross-validation</b>.  The development branches are typically pulled from the master.</p>

<p>This app was developed as a protype to see how some simple ideas might be implemented.  A more feature-rich version capable of more advanced simulations is planned to be done in Python.</p>

<h4>Bugs</h4>
<p>I welcome feedback on the app.  If you see an issue, kindly submit an issue from the <b>Issues</b> tab of the github repo.  Thanks!</p>
